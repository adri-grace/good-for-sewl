# Good for the Sew-l
With so much digital time during my bootcamp, I am craving some NON-digital creative time and a little inspiration. This will be a Pinterest-style app where visitors can view other people's projects and get some inspiration. After sign up or log in, users can also add, review, edit, or delete their own projects that will be shared in the main page feed.

This will be a React App using MERN
