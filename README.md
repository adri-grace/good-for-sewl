# Good for the Sew-l
https://good-for-your-sewl.herokuapp.com/

### Project Overview
With so much digital time during my bootcamp, I am craving some NON-digital creative time and a little inspiration. This will be a Pinterest-style app where visitors can view other people's projects and get some inspiration. After sign up or log in, users can also add, review, edit, or delete their own projects that will be shared in the main page feed.
* Visitor: Land on a page with name/logo, nav links, a brief description of site, and easily recognizable login and sign-up areas
* Visitor or User: can view existing projects, presented in a 'card' format, visible on the home page.
* User: Fill out a sign-up form, with first and last name, email and password, to create an account on Good for your Sew-l
* User: Securely login from home page and display all user's projects
* User: Create a new project with identifying title, description, pattern information, add an image link
* User: Delete projects
* User: Edit project information
